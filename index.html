        <p>
          The following quiz will test your knowledge of JavaScript
          fundamentals. You will be alloted 10 seconds for each question in the
          quiz, but try to answer quickly and accurately as you'll have the
          opportunity to submit your score based on the time remaining. Be
          aware, a wrong answer will deduct 5 seconds from the clock!
